Hi Mark,

Thanks for agreeing to do the exclusive. We won’t let you down. Here’s a list of basic questions to get you going. If you could type out the answers on the grid, and then e-mail them back to me at some point, that would be good for me. Please say anything, for plenty is better than too little.

1: Gloom. That sounds a bit like Doom, doesn't it?
2: Is it meant to be as close a version as possible?
3: Have you seen any other Doom 'clones' on the Amiga? Say, Poom, for instance, Death Mask or Alien Breed 3D? Any comments, or would you rather not 'diss' the opposition?
4: How long have you been working on it?
5: When you started Gloom, did you have any idea how it would turn out? Presumably it took a while to code the 3D routine - but were you sure that it was possible?
6: Talk about some of the problems you came across when writing it.
7: The demo we have is quite big. How big will the final game be?
8: Talking speed for a while: does the frame rate increase depending on what processor you have? How about screen size/resolution?
9: The two-player mode is a good innovation - but will there be a null modem link-up too? That really works with Doom.
10: If the main code is assembler, is Blitz used at all?
11: The other people in Black Magic - have they done anything before? 
12: Do you anticipate any trouble from id Software?

13: Er, and the final question is: do you have anything more to say? This is going to be a big preview - four pages - so if you can spout as much information as you can about Gloom it would be appreciated. I need the answers asap - Friday would be good, Monday if not.

Oh yeah, and if you have any screen shots, or some demos of other levels/enemies/characters that we could use as decorations, they would be cool too.

E-Mail me if there's a problem.
