Black Magic is a new development team who aim to produce fun, playable and
down-right interesting games for a range of platforms. The team currently
consist of:

Mark Sibly - programmer - the dude responsible for Blitz Basic 2, Overkill,
Guardian and a string of less memorable products.

Kurt and Hans Butler - artists (extraordinaire) - no past convictions, but
contributions to Skidmarks, Overkill, Guardian and the infamous Gladiators
scandal mark them out as serious contendors.

Kev Stannard - musician - a man with a troubled past who has every right to
think the worst of the games scene, but is soldiering on bravely none the less.
